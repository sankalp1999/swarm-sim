# Swarm Intelligence Simulation

### Boids vs Predator with Evolution

> **Boids** are artificial life forms following three simple rules:

- **Alignment** - Match direction with neighbors
- **Cohesion** - Stay close to the group
- **Separation** - Avoid collisions

A **predator** hunts the swarm, forcing evolution. Boids that survive reproduce, passing on genetic traits like speed and evasion abilities. Successful boids automatically reproduce every ~15 seconds.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time evolution across generations
- Self-attention mechanism for global awareness
- Interactive predator control (arrow keys)
- Emergent survival strategies

Watch as simple rules create complex, lifelike behaviors!
